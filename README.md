## K-DST

K-DST Radio Station app (from a popular open-world driving game from 2004) for iOS.

Just a template, will not work without files from the game itself which I don't provide!

VERY simple app, this plays the songs in a random shuffled order. Inbetween songs is a bit of DJ chat, radio soundbites etc and a random number of up to 5 "commercials" (also from the game).

Adverts, DJ chat and soundbites randomised. Also many songs have different intros/outros, each with different DJ chat overlays. Where applicable these are also randomised.

Screen will not go off when this app is open, mainly so it can be used in the car etc without having to keep unlocking screen. Portrait and landscape modes supported, works on iPhone/iPad (only iPhone X and 9.7" iPad Pro tested though). If you connect this to a bluetooth car radio "K-DST" will appear on the screen, as if you're in the game itself!

# Controls:
* Play/pause: self-explanatory!
* Reset: Re-shuffles the play order.
* Skip: Also self explanatory, kinda. This skips the current file, so skipping the song intro takes you to the main body of the song etc. Skips adverts one at a time.
