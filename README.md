## K-DST

K-DST Radio Station app (from a popular open-world driving game from 2004) for iOS.

Just a template, will not work without files from the game itself which I don't provide!

VERY simple app, this plays the songs in a random shuffled order. Inbetween songs is a bit of DJ chat, radio soundbites etc and a random number of up to 5 adverts.

Adverts, DJ chat and soundbites randomised. Also many songs have different intros/outros, each with different DJ chat overlays. Where applicable these are also randomised.

# Controls:
* Play/pause: self-explanatory!
* Reset: Re-shuffles the play order.
* Skip: Also self explanatory, kinda. This skips the current file, so skipping the song intro takes you to the main body of the song etc. Skips adverts one at a time.
